### My streamlit app

This repo demonstrates how to turn a simple script into a streamlit app for a blog post.

We take a simple python script (`my_script.py`) into a simple dashboard with streamlit (`my_dashboard.py`).

To run, 
```
streamlit run my_dashboard.py
```

The dashboard is available from the streamlit cloud, which points to this repo.
The app is loaded from `streamlit_app.py`.
